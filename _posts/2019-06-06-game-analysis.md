title: "Video games over the last 20 years - exploratory analysis"
---


This [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/egrinstein/20-years-of-games) contains information on video games released between 1996 and 2016. Some of the things that I will investigate in this project are popular publishing platforms and common genres. We'll illustrate our findings with some charts and diagrams.
