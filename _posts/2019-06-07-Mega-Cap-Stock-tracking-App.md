Here is the **link for the app**. (*Edit: removed to save cost so you can look at the screenshot below instead*)

I have used the following Python libraries in this project: Pandas, Matplotlib, YFinance, MPLFinance, and Requests.

The app is created using the Streamlit framework and hosted on Streamlit Cloud.

All of the financial data is scraped from Yahoo Finance in real time while the 'relevant news' data comes from NewsAPI.

Some screenshots below:
