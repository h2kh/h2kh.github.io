	<p>I've always been curious (some might say overly so). My undergrad degree in Economics didn't do much to sate my curiosity though so I've
	spent the last couple of years aggressively learning and trying new things. That process of discovery has led me to data science.</p>

	<p style="font-size:14px;">At first, I approached data science like I did my undergrad education: a bottom-up piecing together of different topics like calculus, statistics, 
		algorithms etc. That didn't last long because it didn't help me look at the bigger picture (i.e. the real-world 
	applications of data science). So I decided to go  the other way: from top to bottom.</p>

	<p>I completed the Professional Data Science Certificate offered by IBM where I got familiar with data science methodologies, Python, 
	databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning. And with those tools in hand, I've started 'doing' data science 
	as opposed to 'reading about' data science which I was doing earlier. Machine learning techniques that I've covered include linear and logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, clustering, principal components analysis, and anomaly detection. Here are some of the projects I've completed:</p>
